## Hi there 👋

My name is Dawson, and I'm a Speech/Audio research engineer focused on low-resource African soundscapes and privacy-preserving ASR. 
I build datasets and train/evaluate models with slice-aware metrics (SNR/site) and calibration.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a cloud-based, human-in-the-loop Asante Twi→English transcription/translation platform, built around court and high-stakes domains, that combines modern transformer ASR/MT, rich editing tools, and a data flywheel to create a sovereign, domain-specialized speech system for Ghana.
- - 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to robust audio understanding for under-represented soundscapes
